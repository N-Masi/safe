Stratified Predictions over Earth

To unify the coordinate system across all integrated data sources, latitude ranges from -90 to 90 and longitude from 0 to -0 (ex: [0, 10, 20, ..., 170, -180, -170, ..., -10]). This is because metadata sourced from pygeoboundaries_geolab follows this coordinate system, and it is easiest to bring tabular data into conformance.

### Testing

Run `pytest` in the terminal
